throttle cpu temp

    This Linux application collects the temperature of the processor, and if
    the temperature gets higher than a configured maximum, it starts to
    throttle down the processor frequency to reduce the temperature.

    It was created to cope with high processor temperature on laptops when
    doing large compilations (ex: Linux kernel).

    The idea and logic were based on `https://github.com/Sepero/temp-throttle',
    a shell script. This application were ported to Go, and it is intended to
    be executed as a daemon.
